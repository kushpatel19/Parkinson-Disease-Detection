# Parkinson-Disease-Detection

This project aims to make use of Machine Leaning techniques to detect wheather a person have Perkinson's disease or not. In this project, following taaka were performed.
- Data Processing
- Data Collection
- Data Analysis
- Data Balancing-Scaling
- Data Standerdization
- Machine Learning Model Training, Testing & Evaluation

## Machine Learning Classification

I have used following classifications models and then choose the best one according to the accuracy score.
- Support Vector Machine Model
- Logistic Regression
- AdaBoost Classifier
- RandomForest Classifier
- GaussianNB
- K Nearest Neighbor(KNN)
- DecisionTree Classifier
- XGB Classifier
- XGBRF Classifier

After model fitting, I did Hyperparameter Tuning on the model to increase the accuracy of the model by the following techniques.
- GridSearchCV
- RandomizedSearchCV
